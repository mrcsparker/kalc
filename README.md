kalc
====

kalc is a small functional programming language that (gasp) borrows a lot of its
syntax from the Excel formula language.

ikalc
-----

kalc comes with its own repl, known as `ikalc`. Start it up in your console by
typing in `ikalc`

Syntax
------

kalc is a tiny language, and it has very little syntax. It supports
functions, variable assignment, arithmetic, and some string parsing
functionality.

Numbers
-------

All numbers are BigDecimal ruby class numbers for precision.

    1 => 1.0
    2.020 => 2.02
    1.23E => 12300000000.0

Arithmetic
----------

    1 + 1 / (10 * 100) - 3 + 3 - (3 - 2)
    SUM(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Arithmetic is standard infix with nesting via parenthesis.

Logical operations
------------------

    2 < 1 ? 1 : 3 # Ternary
    (1 || 2) # 1.0
    2 or 3 # 2.0
    OR(1 > 2, 3 < 2, 8 == 8) # true

Variable assignment
-------------------

The assignment operator `:=` is borrowed from Pascal.  This decision was
made for practical reason.  Since comparison operators are both `=` and
`==` and the language is expression-based, `=` could not be chosen.

Variables come in a lot of different flavors.

You have standard variables:

    a := 1 b := 2 d := a + b

    d := 100.0

and you have quoted variables:

    'a' := 1 'b' := 2 'd' := 'a' + 'b'

Quoted variables can contain pretty much any character that you can
think of:

    'Hello world' := 1
    'Hello 2 the world' := 1
    'This \' is a \' [string]' := 1
    '!@#$%^& !@#$%^& *&^%$%^&*' := 1

The only real rule is that you need to escape a standard single quote.

Functions
---------

You can create functions in kalc:

    DEFINE FOO(a, b) { a + b }

You can also call functions in kalc:

    \> a = FOO(2, 3) \> a 5

There are a few examples of functions in `lib/stdlib.kalc`

Built-in functions
------------------

There are some built-in functions (in `lib/kalc/interpreter.rb`). They are based
on the Excel formula functions, so you should see some overlap.

Some of them are:

    # Conditional
    IF, OR, NOT, AND

    # Random number generation
    RAND

    # System level integration
    SYSTEM

    # Boolean functions
    ISLOGICAL, ISNONTEXT, ISNUMBER, ISTEXT

    # Math functions
    ABS, DEGREES, PRODUCT, RADIANS, ROUND, SUM, TRUNC, LN, ACOS,
    ACOSH, ASIN, ASINH, ATAN, ATANH, CBRT, COS, COSH, ERF, ERFC, EXP, GAMMA,
    LGAMMA, LOG, LOG2, LOG10, SIN, SINH, SQRT, TAN, TANH, MIN, MAX

    # String functions
    CHOMP, CHOP, CHR, CLEAR, COUNT, DOWNCASE, HEX, INSPECT, INTERN, TO_SYM, LENGTH, SIZE,
    LSTRIP, SUCC, NEXT, OCT, ORD, REVERSE, RSTRIP, STRIP, SWAPCASE, TO_C,
    TO_F, TO_I, TO_R, UPCASE, CHAR, CLEAN, CODE, CONCATENATE, DOLLAR, EXACT,
    FIND, FIXED, LEFT, LEN, LOWER, MID, PROPER, REPLACE, REPT, RIGHT,
    SEARCH, SUBSTITUTE, TRIM, UPPER, VALUE

    # Regular expression functions
    REGEXP_MATCH, REGEXP_REPLACE

    # Debugging
    P, PP, PUTS,

    # Other
    PLUS_ONE, MINUS_ONE, SQUARE, CUBE, FIB, FACTORIAL,
    TOWERS_OF_HANOI

Loops
-----

There are no looping mechanisms to speak of, but recursion works (pretty) well.
**Note:** *go too deep and you might blow the stack!*

    DEFINE SAMPLE_LOOP(a) {
      PUTS(a)
      IF(a == 1, 1, SAMPLE_LOOP(a - 1))
    }

There are a few examples of loops via recursion in `lib/stdlib.kalc`

Weirdness
---------

And here is where it gets a bit weird. It has to look a bit like Excel, so you
can expect things to look odd in places.

For example, here is how you compare 2 variables:

    # Assign '1' to 'a' and '2' to 'b' a := 1 b := 2

    # Does 'a' equal 'b'? a = b \> false

    # Also, you can do this: a == b \> false

    (a == a) && (b = b) \> true

`=` and `==` are both equality operators. Use `:=` for assignment.

More inside
-----------

Not everything is documented yet. As you can see, it is a mix of a lot of
different ideas. The goal is to have an excel-like language that is somewhat
functional.
